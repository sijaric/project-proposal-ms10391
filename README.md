# Project Proposal

### Project title

Gene-Drug Interaction Warning

### What and why?

A platform that accepts genetic data formatted and provided by genetic testing companies, e.g. 23andme and Ancestry.com, which allows users to upload that data onto this platform for the purpose of checking your eligibility for various medications (on the basis of publicly available databases that indicate drug-gene interactions).

It's important because of the current lack of user friendly interfaces that allow people who already have genetic reports to extract potentially life saving warnings, bringing us one step closer to realizing the promises of precision medicine.

### For whom?

Anyone who is taking a medication or is about to begin a new one, and already has a genetic report from one or more of the major testing geneticproviders. 23andme alone has about 12 million users, demonstrating the enormous potential reach.

### How?

Once the raw data provided by a provider has been downloaded, the user would create a profile and upload that file onto the platform. They may then request a general report for medications that might not be well tolerated.

### Scope

It is not too easy in the sense that this requires careful importations and handling of large amounts of data, as well as the steps inherent in the set up of environments allowing for the creation of comprehensiv user profiles, and it is not too difficult in the sense that the data needed would be available in a format that is relatively standardized.
